# üè° House Price Prediction ‚Äì SCT_ML_01

This project is a simple machine learning model that predicts house sale prices based on features like above-ground living area, number of bedrooms, and full bathrooms. The model uses **Linear Regression** and provides a **Streamlit UI** for interactive predictions.
